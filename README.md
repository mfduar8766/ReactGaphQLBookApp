# ReactGaphQLBookApp
Books/Authors App using React/GraphQL. This app demonstrates the use of a GraphQL back end to query an API and retrieve the information that is needed from it as opposed to the traditional REST API calls. This project uses MongoDB as the backend along with an express server to host it. It uses mutations to retrieve the information and display it on the client side. It also uses Apollo to assist with the mutations and queries on the client side.
